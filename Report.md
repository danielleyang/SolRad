##Running report

------

Organization:
	- List on Github (simplest, easiest to learn)
	-

Data
	
	- CARB: Lots of data, not everything needed. Relevant
	  parameters might be:
	  - PM2.5, PM10, ozone, aerosols
	  - Read the README with the DVDs - pick out relevant
		parts of the data.
	  - Webscrape CARB website needed for 2015-2016 data? Everything
				else is on DVDs. 

	- Crop data: Start simple: one crop, plateau period - build code with
		  flexibility for more crops
	  - Rice, 1992 - 1995, California.
	  - Available at county level from USDA
	  - Have experimental data from 1995-2015 (Open Science Foundation)				  
	- Alternate dataset might have both solar radiation and air
            quality: CERM (XXX will look at)
			
   	- Solar radiation: Many sources of data. 
	  - Look at the CIMIS data first 
	  - 4 stations in rice area, Davis, Colusa, Durham, and
		Nicolaus/Verona. 
	  - Colusa is likely the most representative.
	  
Other:

We did not explicitly talk about this during the meeting, but it is
really important that we look for existing functions to gather this
data if possible.

If there is an existing package out there, please use it rather than
writing your own code.

First meeting of the group. Brief introductions and discussed some
general goals for the project.

Decisions:
	- We will use Slack for small communications within the group or
      between members of the same task
	- Group emails will be for big announcements
	- Weekly meetings will be to discuss status, adjust tasks, work
      through bottlenecks or difficult issues.
