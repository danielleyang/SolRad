##Running report
 
17 Jan 2017
------

First meeting of the group. Brief introductions and discussed some
general goals for the project.

Decisions:
	- We will use Slack for small communications within the group or
      between members of the same task
	- Group emails will be for big announcements
	- Weekly meetings will be to discuss status, adjust tasks, work
      through bottlenecks or difficult issues.
