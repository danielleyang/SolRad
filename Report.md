##Running report

------

Organization:
	- List on Github (simplest, easiest to learn)
	-

Data
	
	- CARB: Lots of data, not everything needed. Relevant
	  parameters might be:
	  - PM2.5, PM10, ozone, aerosols
	  - Read the README with the DVDs - pick out relevant
		parts of the data.
	  - Webscrape CARB website needed for 2015-2016 data? Everything
				else is on DVDs. 

	- Crop data: Start simple: one crop, plateau period - build code with
		  flexibility for more crops
	  - Rice, 1992 - 1995, California.
	  - Available at county level from USDA
	  - Have experimental data from 1995-2015 (Open Science Foundation)				  
	- Alternate dataset might have both solar radiation and air
            quality: CERM (XXX will look at)
			
   	- Solar radiation: Many sources of data. 
	  - Look at the CIMIS data first 
	  - 4 stations in rice area, Davis, Colusa, Durham, and
		Nicolaus/Verona. 
	  - Colusa is likely the most representative.

First meeting of the group. Brief introductions and discussed some
general goals for the project.

Decisions:
	- We will use Slack for small communications within the group or
      between members of the same task
	- Group emails will be for big announcements
	- Weekly meetings will be to discuss status, adjust tasks, work
      through bottlenecks or difficult issues.
