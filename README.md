#Investigating the effects of solar radiation and pollution on crop yield

This is a new project, being offered as a series of weekly hacking
sessions through the UC Davis Data Science Initative. The activity for
each week is aimed at addressing certain aspects of this project, with
the project having been separated into pieces that can be taken up one
at a time, with little or no knowledge of the previous steps needed to
contribute.

###Background

It is generally assumed that crop yields in California are not limited
by solar radiation because the Mediterranian climate results in little
cloud cover during the growing season, and on a clear day solar
radiation is in excess of the amount crops can use. However,
preliminary analysis suggests that airborne pollutants can reduce the
amount of solar radiation to the point of impacting crop yields. This
project seeks to weigh the evidence that pollution is impacting crop
yields using historical data derived from multiple sources.
