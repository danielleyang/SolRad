#Investigating the effects of solar radiation and pollution on crop yield

This is a new project, being offered as a series of weekly hacking
sessions through the UC Davis Data Science Initiative. The activity for
each week is aimed at addressing certain aspects of this project, with
the project having been separated into pieces that can be taken up one
at a time, with little or no knowledge of the previous steps needed to
contribute. However, it also provides an opportunity to participate in
project management and using different tools in the workflow of a
project.

This is a good opportunity to get hands-on experience with different 
concepts, skills and tools in the data pipeline and to potentially 
develop elements of your data science portfolio.

We'll work as a group (and subgroups), so you will be able to learn from others rather
than needing to know how to do everything yourself.

###Background

It is generally assumed that crop yields in California are not limited
by solar radiation because the
[Mediterranean climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate) 
results in little cloud cover during the growing season, and on a clear day
solar radiation is in excess of the amount crops can use. However,
preliminary analysis suggests that airborne pollutants can reduce the
amount of solar radiation to the point of impacting crop yields. This
project seeks to weigh the evidence that pollution is impacting crop
yields using historical data derived from multiple sources.
