##Notes for the Solar Radiation Project prior to the first meeting

Authorship of any papers:
		- Anyone who attends the meetings and provides some feedback gets in the Acknowledgement section
  		- Significant contributions (e.g., solve one aspect of the project) we be offered authorship
  		- If concerned, we can talk more in person

Anticipated products:
		- Journal publications:
    	- Paper on the relationship between crop yields and solar radiation and pollution
	  	- Case study on what is learned by collaborative data science in action

  		- R packages?

Reporting:
	- To support the above, incremental reports are needed so that at
	any stage, we know (1) where we are at with the project and (2) how we
	got there, including what worked and what did not.

  	- These reports are essential to building the case study, allowing
    people to contribute to the project without requiring constant
    involvement, and allow independent teams to all contribute
    simultaniously.

  	- We will need to decide the best format for these. Possibly as
  	simple as two long documents where the most recent activity is at
  	the top, detailing the progress since the previous section.

Involvement:
	- Every level of involvement is welcome, however we ask
	that you do not take on a task without intent to see it to
	completion. If a task is taking a long time to complete, other
	individuals are welcome to tackle it. The goal is a finished projec,
	not equal involvement.

	- It is likely some aspects will not work or
	will prove more difficult that first thought. People are encouraged to
	seek help early, since the strength of the project rests with the
	group.

Weekly meetings:
	- The weekly meetings will serve as status
	meetings. We will review what has been accomplished since the last
	meeting, discuss potential solutions to any problems that we
	encountered, and strategize for the next stages. The tasks may need to
	be adjusted if one does not seem feasible.
